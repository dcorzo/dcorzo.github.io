            <h3>If you're a New Jersey resident, or visiting, you're lucky ...</h3>
            <p>I've compiled a few of my favorite New Jersey downtowns that I 
                strongly recommend you visit. Each one of these locations 
                exhibit a fun atmosphere with snacks shops and restaurants 
                scattered around, guaranteeing you and your partner a whole 
                day's worth of enjoyment and relaxation. Let me know in the 
                review tab if you would like more recommendations!

            <h2>1. Westfield</h2>
            <p>Here is a downtown that I find myself returning to time and time 
                again. Downtown Westfield is a perfect place to take a date, 
                either it be to make a good first impression or to keep the 
                sparks going with your long-time lover. You can have fun in an 
                arcade that has it all, walk around during sunset to admire the 
                colorful buildings around, and wrap up your night with a dinner 
                that won't disappoint. My personal favorites for a top rating 
                dining experience would be <em>Spice Bazaar</em>, an Indian 
                cuisine restaurant with the friendliest staff and the best of 
                food, or <em>Sweet Waters Steakhouse</em>, a classy restaurant 
                famous for their, well, steaks, although I will say their 
                french onion soup is a must try. As for the arcade that has it 
                all, Westfield's <em>Yestercades</em> is a favorite for people 
                of all ages, with its wide variety of retro arcade games as 
                well as pool tables and more. This arcade is guaranteed to keep 
                you and your partner entertained, or competing.   
            </p>

            <h2>2. Summit</h2>
            <p>Downtown Summit is a sweet little downtown that some people may 
                dismiss, but it certainly is never empty at peak hours. All 
                around this downtown are lights set up around stores and lamp 
                posts to give an almost cozy Christmas feeling when walking 
                around with your partner. Here is where I would go for a date 
                to really connect with my partner by spending some solid 
                quality time with them. <em>McCool's Ice Cream</em> is a very 
                small, but very tasty shop that will never leave your eyes or 
                tastebuds dissatisfied because of its wide variety of flavors 
                and creative colors. Now to wind down and enjoy your ice cream, 
                you can head over to <em>Scotti's Record Shop</em> and browse 
                this vintage style shop that sells all kinds of vinyls, from 
                jazz to hip hop and more. Now, two of my favorite places that I 
                can rely on for a good bite with a good vibe would be <em>Roots 
                Steakhouse</em>, an upscale restaurant where you will always 
                leave with a happy tummy (even if your wallet may not be), and 
                <em>Summit Diner</em>, a cute little diner perfect for a casual 
                bite at any time of the day.

            <h2>3. Jersey City</h2>
            <p>Just taking a day to walk around Jersey City is good enough as a 
                date because of its perfect placement for sunset pictures of 
                the sky. While that may just be my own opinion, a nice sunset 
                can really elevate the romance of any date night, especially if 
                the rest of your day is filled with all the fun activities 
                available in Jersey City. Aside from the vast amount of street 
                art that fills this downtown, there are also sometimes fairs 
                and festivals that are sure to hit at least one interest. 
                Downtown Jersey City has got to be one of my favorites when it 
                comes to casual snacking. One of my favorite spots to go to is 
                <em>Bang Cookies</em>, where they sell some of the best cookies 
                either of us have ever had, while simultaneously using only 
                organic ingredients. As for a romantic dining experience, head 
                on over to <em>Skinner's Loft</em>, where they sometimes have 
                live jazz to accompany the most intimate ambience for dining. 
                For anyone that might be interested in thrifting clothes or 
                finding vintage gems, make sure to stop at <em>Another Man's 
                Treasure</em>. It has the perfect atmosphere for an avid (or 
                beginner) thrifter and will guarantee you leave with at least an 
                item.
