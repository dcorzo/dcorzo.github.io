<!-- The theme I picked for my website is a date ideas website, under the name 
    of Haven District. 
    
    In my first page I wrote an article about date ideas I 
    recommend, with the second page exhibiting my schedule (doesn't follow the 
    theme, it was difficult to come up with something related to it where I can 
    use a table, so I went with the latter option of putting my schedule). The 
    third page is a review tab for readers to submit feedback about the article 
    and their experience, while the fourth page is an article that recommmends 
    some of my favorite downtowns for dates in New Jersey.

        <h3>If you're looking for date ideas, look no further ...</h3>
        <p class="intro">Here I have collected 4 of the best date ideas for couples (or dating
            pairs if you haven't taken the step yet!) who are searching for fun. 
            Half of these options allow for entertainment within the comfort of 
            your own home, while the others request that you and your counterpart 
            go explore out in your neighborhood or nearby cities. Nonetheless, 
            all serve to provide you both a wonderful experience, and don't be
            afraid to add your own little spin to my ideas. </p>

        <h2>1. Movie Night with Snacks</h2>
        <p>One of the best experiences I've had is watching movies with a 
            special someone. I've always had a list of movies or series I wanted
            to watch, but never found the time to watch it or I preferred to 
            watch with someone. Putting a night together towards a movie you 
            both want to watch can be fun. Not only does it allow you to stay 
            in the comfort of your home, but it is very cost efficient as well 
            (as long as you have some streaming service where you can watch 
            movies). Before settling on your couch, go to your local 
            supermarket or corner-store and pick up some snacks for the both 
            of you to enjoy. As everybody knows, popcorn is a movie favorite, 
            so make sure to add that to your shopping list. Finally, grab a 
            blanket, and cuddle away as you enjoy the experience.

        <h2>2. Park Picnic with Painting Activity</h2>
        <p>Some people might say picnics are outdated, but I find it to be a 
            very intimate experience because of how immersed it is in nature. 
            It is the perfect time for you and your partner to create your own 
            fruit bowl, craft your favorite sandwiches or sliders, and … paint! 
            Not only are parks filled with nature's beautiful structures, but 
            they provide the perfect aesthetic for a painting date. You can even
            paint portraits of each other, and it might be equally or more fun 
            to make them silly. Go to your local arts and craft shop and buy 
            two small canvases with some paint and brushes. Sometimes you can 
            find kits bundled with all the resources you may need. Buy your 
            picnic snacks and find a nice, relaxing spot at your local park 
            for your sweet memory to be born.

        <h2>3. Bake Your Favorite Treats</h2>
        <p>Home-baked goods always bring an inner warm feeling, or maybe that's 
            because they're served straight out the oven. Nonetheless, making 
            your own baked treats is always a great experience. Whether you're 
            experienced or new, baking doesn't require much skill to get 
            started. If you're more familiar with baking and have the skills to 
            impress, you can find a recipe for a treat you both enjoy or want 
            to try. Now, if you're a beginner, don't worry! Simple baking mixes 
            are available at your local supermarket, and they still provide 
            great tasting treats. I strongly recommend 
            
            <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Betty-Crocker-Ready-to-Bake-Chocolate-Chip-Cookie-Mix-17-5-oz/10311487?athbdg=L1200&from=/search"><em>Betty Crocker's Chocolate Chip Mix</em></a>
            
            as it's always worked out great for me. Finally, 
            once your baked goods are ready to eat, enjoy while you both spend 
            the rest of the night reminiscing about the silly mistakes and 
            mess-ups that happened in the process.

        <h2>4. Visit a Downtown New to the Both of You</h2>
        <p>While nature's structures are very beautiful, human's structures can 
            be as visually pleasing. Wherever you may live, try to find a 
            nearby city with a nice downtown for walking. Cities usually have 
            strip districts filled with shops and restaurants, so plan your 
            path efficiently and make a reservation for the cuisine of your 
            delight. It's important to reserve ahead of time if the downtown of 
            your choice happens to be a big city like NYC or Los Angeles. 
            Downtowns may also have small markets set up, especially during the 
            holiday season, so make sure to plan for such dates. And for a 
            little heads-up, be ready to spend if you or your partner love to 
            shop or eat. Downtowns tend to have snack shops at every corner. I 
            recommend visiting the downtown of your choice late-afternoon, so 
            you can witness the sky dim and city lights brighten and watch the 
            streets liven up with people looking for the same fun as the both 
            of you.
